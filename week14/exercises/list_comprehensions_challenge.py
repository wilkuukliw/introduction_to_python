""" 
    List Comprehension chalenges. 
    All the below exercieses, unless something else is stated, should be solved using: 
    * first a normal for loop, then a 
    * list comprehensions and a
    * a generator expression (where it makes sense)

    You should also run the 'timer' and 'memory usage' decorators on your new functions. 
    Try to see if you in anyway can optimize you code.
    (It is a good idea to test your solutions with large numbers and see how they react)

# 1. Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by 7

# 2. Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that have a 3 in them

# 3. Count the number of spaces in a string

# 4. Remove all of the vowels in a string

# 5. In a string made up of randomly generated words, generate a list of all words that have less than 4 letters

# 6. Use a dictionary comprehension to count the length of each word in a sentence.

# 7. Use a nested list comprehension to find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by any single digit besides 1 (2-9)

# 8. For all the numbers 1-1000, use a nested list comprehension to find the highest single digit any of the numbers is divisible by

# 9. Multiples of 3 and 5: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
