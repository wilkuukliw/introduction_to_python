Week 13 - Decorators
====================

.. sidebar:: Learning goals
    :subtitle: After this week you will know about:

    Decorators in python that are widely used to add new functionallity to already existing code, and you will be able to understand and explain the inner stucture (implementation)

    More specific you will learn about:
        - First class functions 
        - Inner functions
        - Decorator functions
        - Decorator classes 


This week will be about decorators. You have already used decorators in your code. A :code:`@property` is an example of this, but today you will be making your own decorators.

The boilerplate syntax of a decorator is like this:

.. code:: python 
   :linenos:

   def decorator(func):
       def wrapper_decorator(*args, **kwargs):
               # Do something before
               value = func(*args, **kwargs) // execute function
               # Do something after
               return value
       
       return wrapper_decorator

And if you want to use it you will do like so:

.. code:: python
   :linenos:

   @decorator
   def greet(name):
        return 'Hello ' + name


By reading the texts in the materials section, doing the 3 exercises, and follow the teachings, you will be able to explain what a decorator is, when to use it, and how the inner parts of a decorator function is made up, and you will be able to create your own, and use others already made decorators.

Ex1: Time it!
-------------

Next week we will work with *generators*, *generator expressions* and *list comprehensions*. These topics has a lot to do with program efficiency. 

For this we will be measuring our code in diffenrent ways and especialy we will *'time it'* and *'messure memmory usage'*. 

If you want to messure how much time it takes to execute a piece of code you could do the followin:

.. code:: python
   :linenos:

   import time

   start = time.time()
   // do some stuff you want to meassure here
   end = time.time()
   print(end - start)

   
Instead of writing this every time you need to time something, you could write a docorator function that does the job for you. 

**Task:**

Your job is, to write a decorator function that can time any piece of code.

You can read about time by starting your interpretor and write:

.. code:: python

   > import time
   > help(time)



   
.. _ex2:

--------------------
Ex2: memory-profiler 
--------------------

Measuring the memory ussage of an object, function or piece of code can be of equally importance as the timing functionallity you just created.

Python has a build in module called :code:`resource`. This is a unix system only module, so here all windows users can not find much help.

But some third party modules luckily exists. In this exercise, you should work with one of these.

Go to this url https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/ and use the module. Notice that you are using a decorator when using this module. 



.. _ex3: 

-------------------
Ex3: Slow down code
------------------- 


The code below counts down from n -> 0. So calling countdown(5) prints: 5 4 3 2 1 Liftoff!

.. code:: python
   :linenos:

   def countdown(n):
        if not n:   # 0 is false, not false is true
            return n
        else:
            print(n, end=' ')
            return countdown(n-1) # call the same function with n as one less 


(The function is a recursive function, which you might or might not have worked with before.)

**Task:**

Create a decorator function that slows down your code by 1 second for each step. Call this function *slowdown()*


For this you should  use the 'time' module.
                        
When you got the 'slowdown code' working on this recursive function, try to create a more (for you) normal function that does the countdown using a loop, and see what happens if you decorate that function with you slowdown() function.
