Week 10 - OOP
=============

.. sidebar:: Learning goals
    :subtitle: After having worked with these topics you will be able to:
      
      - create Classes, Objects, instance and class variables, methods and initializer methods. 
      - make use of single and multiple inheritance.   
      - explain when and why to use classes and objects instead of procedural style. 
      - relate the pythonic OOP style to other languages  (Java e.g) 
      - create doctests for your python code.


Today we will work with the basics of Object oriented programming in python. You will learn how to include tests in you applications, and you will have exercises that deals with Bank accounts, Angry birds.

EX 1: Bank Exercise 
-------------------

`Solution <../week10/exercises/solution/bank.py>`_

Create a Bank, an Account, and a Customer class.

* All classes should be in a single file. 
* The bank class should be able to hold many account.
* You should be able to add new accounts.
* The Account class should have relevant details.
* The Customer class Should also have relevant details.

Stick to the techniques we have covered so far, and be sure to create doctests.


**Overloading**

Add the abillity in your code to overload one or more init methods

**Hand in on fronter**

When you are done you should hand in you solution on fronter. You should after this assess 2 other students solutions. (code review, what is good, what is not so good etc.). Who you should assess is handled by fronter (hopefully :))

Ex 2: Angry Bird
----------------

`Solution <../week10/exercises/solution/angry_bird.py>`_

In this exercises you are going to create a simple terminal version of this `Angry Bird online coding teaching tool for kids <https://studio.code.org/hoc/1>`_ .

.. image:: _static/angry_bird.png

You should make this as an OOP application, and your classes could be like this. 

**Bird**

Should know its *current position*, and should know in what *direction* it is moving. It should be able to *move forward*, *turn left*, and *turn right*.
It should also have an action invoked when it looses the game, and one when it wins. 


**Pig**

Should know its *position*. 
It should also have an action invoked when it looses the game, and one when it wins. 

**Board**

Should initialize a Bird and a Pig object. It should *display* the board with the bird and the pig in starting positions. It should have a *run method*

.. code::

        *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
        *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
        *  *  B  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
        *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
        *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
        *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
        *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
        *  *  *  *  *  *  P  *  *  *
        *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
        *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *


**Workspace**

Should have a display method printing out instructions on what to do. It should have a method being responsible of creating a collection of commands from user input. 


**Game**

This class is responsible of running the application. It should create objects of Board and Workspace and call their display methods. It should also be responsible for deciding if the bird hit the pig or not.

You can see a prototype of this exercise here. You are of cause welcome to improve the game, but this could be a solution.
