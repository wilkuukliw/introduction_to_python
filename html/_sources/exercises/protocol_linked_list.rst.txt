Exercise: Protocol - linked-list
================================

In python there is not a build in linked list. If you want to use this datastructure, you either have to make it yourself or import a module (where someone else did it for you.). 

You should chose the first option: create it yourself.

Definition of a linked list
---------------------------

A linked list consists of Node objects with 2 instance variables (data and next).

.. code:: python
   :linenos:

   class Node:
        def __init__(self, data):
                self.data = data 
                self.next = None

And a LinkedList with 1 instance variable:

.. code:: python
   :linenos:

   class LinkedList:
        def __init__(self):
                self.head = None


You can assign Nodes to the list like:

.. code:: bash

   llist = LinkedList()
   llist.head = Node('Data of first Node')        # head is a pointer to a Node with data off 'Data of First Node'
   llinst.head.next = Node('Data of second Node') # next belongs to 'Data of First Node' Node and points to 'Data of second Node' Node.


Task
----
The Linked List should on a higher level behave like the build in List object. So you could in your interpretor type 


.. code:: bash

   >>> help(list)


The underscore methods (__add__ etc.) you can see in the documentation using help(list) should be implemented in your LinkedList (or at least as many as possible)

A description of the implemented methods and their behaviour can be seen here:

.. image:: ../_static/list_tup1.png

.. image:: ../_static/list_tup2.png


The features described below should for sure be implement.  
   
* Make you LinkeList able to tell its length if :code:`len(llist)` is called.
* You should be able to access the lists elements like this :code:`llist[1]` and :code:`llist[-1]`
* The list should be able to handle slicing syntax :code:`llist[1:4]` and :code:`llist[-1:-4:-1]` 
* The list should be able to add new items using this syntax :code:`llist[3] = Node(3)`
* The llinkedList should be able to return a string representation of its state when calling :code:`str()` and :code:`repr()`
* Make the linkedlist able to being added with another linkedlist using the :code:`+` operator
* Multiply the list x times :code:`llist * 3`


Remember that a very good description of these underscore methods can be found in this weeks reading materials.
