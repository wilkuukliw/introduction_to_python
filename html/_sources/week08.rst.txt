Week 8 - Data structures and functions
======================================


.. sidebar:: Learning goals
    :subtitle: After this week you will be able to:
        
        - Work with lists, tuples, Dictionary & sets 
        - Loop over collections with a for & while loop.  
        - Use pythons for loop both as aforeach and a for loop.  
        - Sort collections using the sorted build in function and use its key function to perform custom sorting.  
        - Reading from files using th ebuild in open function. 

Today we will talk about datastructures in python. You will by the end of these sessions be able to use and explain Lists, Tuples, Dictionary & Sets. Work with more details of functions, Read and Write to Files, work with the for and while loop.
