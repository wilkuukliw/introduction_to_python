# Jupyter Notebook

## Getting started with Jupyter Notebook

## Prequisite
Before you install Jupyter Notebook on your system, it is a good idea to set up a [Virtual Enviroment
](virtual_env_setup.md). Jupyter Notebook is a rather large set of files and dependencies, and by putting it in its own enviroment you make it easy for yourself if you at a later point want to change or delete the instalation. 


## Installation

```
    > pip install jupyter
```
## Starting the Jupyter Notebook Server
To start a Jupyter Notebook instance with the parent folder as root: 

```
    > jupyter notebook
```   

A browser window will open and from here on you will work with Jupyter Notebook in the browser.
