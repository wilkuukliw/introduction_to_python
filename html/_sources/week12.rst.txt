Week 12 - The python datamodel
==============================

.. note:: 

   Today is the first day of online teachings.  
   At 8:30 you should log in with your kea credentials at http://teams.microsoft.com. This will be our classroom for the next weeks.  

.. sidebar:: Learning goals
        
     Create your own classes, that behave like any other Python Object 

     
Today we will look at the python data model. 

After this you will be able to implement code in own classes that allow you to use python built-in functions to interact with these object.


   
**Example:**

If you want to be able to use the build in function :code:`len()` on your object you should implement the :code:`__len__` method in your class.  

If you want to be able to use the :code:`==` operator on your object you should implement the :code:`__eq__` method in your class. 

If you want to be able to use the :code:`in` key word on your object you should implement the :code:`__contains__` method in your class. 


Materials
---------

* `A Guide to Python's Magic Methods <https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/>`_
* `Notebook on Datamodel <notebooks/OOP_Encapsulation_Propeties.ipynb#Datamodel>`_
* `Code from today <../week12/code_from_today/>`_

Exercises
---------

------------------
Ex1: Deck of cards
------------------

Continue with the deck example and implement the 

* :code:`__len__` method
* :code:`__add__` method
* :code:`__repr__` method
* :code:`__str__` method
* :code:`__setitem__` method
* :code:`__delitem__` method

We look at this together in a short while.

When you a done, take a look at the 2 exercises below and ask your questions when we meet.
