.. sidebar:: Learning goals
        
        - Setup and run a Virtual Enviroment
        - Install and use Jupyter Notebook
        - Being able to use a Context Manager
        - Creating your own Context Managers
        - Working with JSON files

Today we will work with context managers. Context managers can in short be described as something that takes care of the related tasks of a specific task. An example of this could be when opening a file, the context manager takes care of automaticly closing the file when we are finnished using it.

You will make your own context managers and use already created ones. 

We start out by introducing a new development enviroment, the Jupyter Notebook. And we will in connection with this look at what a virtual enviroment is, and how to use it.
