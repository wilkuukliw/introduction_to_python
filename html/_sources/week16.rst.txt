Week 16 - Recap Week 
====================

This week we use for recap off the topics we covered so far.

The Monday class are welcome to join, you should have access to the tuesday team now. Or you can look at the video recording that will be availiable tuesday at 15:00 in our own team.

The reason for this approach is because of the easter holiday on monday in week 16. Instead of getting "out of sync" with my 2 classes i decided to do it like this. 

There are no video teachings today, but I will be online on Teams so please contact me with your questions. 

The last lessons we covered: 

* **The python Datamodel**
* **Decorators** 

and the coming lessons we will cover 

* **Generators**
* **Context Managers**
* **Meta Programming** 
  
In the Video undernearh James Powell covers these topics. 

Please watch the video, do what he does and contact me for any questions you might have. 

Remember some of it is recap, some of it we will cover in the coming lessons.
